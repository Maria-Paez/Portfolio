## About the Project

The Pokemon Personality Matcher is an interactive project where users answer questions related to their interests, preferences, and fictional abilities. Based on the responses, the program assigns a dominant type—Fire, Water, Grass, or Electric—and randomly selects compatible Pokémon from the matched type’s roster.

## How It Works

1. The program presents five questions to help determine which Pokémon type best fits the user’s personality:
   - How you spend your spare time
   - The element you relate to most
   - Your ideal superpower
   - Your approach to a zombie apocalypse
   - Your preferred fighting style

2. After answering, the program calculates the most frequent type from your responses. Then, it provides a list of three Pokémon from the chosen type as a personality match.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy library

To install NumPy, you can run:
```bash
