## About the Project

This simple yet interactive Python project recommends a list of three movies tailored to your mood. Whether you're feeling happy, sad, bold, or just neutral, this recommender offers movies across various genres to help match or elevate your current vibe.

## How It Works

The program prompts the user to select a mood from four options:
- **Happy**
- **Sad**
- **Bold**
- **Neutral**

Depending on the selected mood, the program generates a list of movie recommendations. It then randomly selects three movies from the mood-appropriate list and displays them to the user.

## Requirements

This project runs on Python 3. There are no external dependencies required.
